## Overview
The Automation Testing repository serves as a centralized hub for all the automation projects I have developed. Its primary purpose is to gather the code for various automation frameworks and tools I have worked on, streamlining access and management. This repository aims to showcase end-to-end testing. By consolidating these projects in one place, I intend to provide a comprehensive resource for developers and QA engineers looking to implement or improve their automation testing processes. Each project within this repository is documented and structured to facilitate easy understanding, setup, and execution, ensuring that users can seamlessly integrate and benefit from these automation tools.
